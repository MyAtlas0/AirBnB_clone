### Description
Now that the command interpreter for managing our AirBnB objects is ready, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:
> Create simple HTML static pages
> Style guide
> Fake contents
> No Javascript
> No data loaded from anything

During this project, we learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. As HTML is the structure of our page, it was the first set of code written. CSS was for the styling of our page, the design. Focused on fixing our HTML part before starting on the styling. because, without any structure, we can’t apply any design.

### Environment
* Language: Html && CSS
* OS: Windows (VsCode x64-1.89.1)
